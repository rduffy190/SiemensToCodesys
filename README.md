This project imports .scl, .db and .udt files created by exporting as source from TIA Portal and creates PLC Open XML for import into Codesys Systems (CtrlX Plc Engineering is the test target) 

UI is... not done but you select a source file and once it's path shows up the exported file is in SiemensExport.XML and can be imported into Codesys systems.
